# Firescarmap

Here we can view a large display of spatial information regarding recent past fires and related details. This map aims to show most of the burn scars in the United States—whether small or large. After fires die down, they often leave the ground with more nutrients and healthier soil than before. Understanding the exact perimeter of each fire, the environmental and ecological impacts it had, and how to help burned or scarred environments recover and thrive is essential. With the ignition date, burn boundaries, and burn year, researchers and companies can take advantage of major opportunities to support regrowth or identify areas of concern for potential mudslides and debris flows. Lastly people/companys can use this large spatial information to target low risk fire zones beacause of fuel being exausted in scared areas.
